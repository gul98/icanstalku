ICanStalkU is a project to raise awareness about inadvertent information sharing. These tools allow individuals to extract EXIF data from images hosted on online photo services.

To get started, check out our [Subversion Repository](http://code.google.com/p/icanstalku/source/checkout) and for the less brave, also read up on the ToolSyntax for documentation.
