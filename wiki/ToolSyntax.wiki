#summary Syntax for stalk.pl and reap.pl

= Introduction =

There are two tools available: 
  * reap.pl - Analyzes a specific photo at a URL
  * stalk.pl - Analyzes each photo in a user's photo stream

= reap.pl =
reap.pl analyzes a single photo at one of the supported photo services and either looks for location related EXIF tags ("geo-tags") and displays the location or displays all the EXIF tags.

== Syntax ==
`reap.pl <url> [--full] [--debug]`

Where URL is a URL to a photo of one of the supported photo services
  * TwitPic
  * YFrog
  * MobyPicture
  * Flickr _(Only flic.kr URLs supported)_
  * Sexypeek

By default, reap.pl will check for geo-tag information only. If _--full_ is given on the command line, reap.pl will print out all EXIF tags embedded in the photo. Running reap.pl with the _--debug_ flag will cause reap.pl to print some diagnostic information.
